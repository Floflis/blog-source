Dreamed of since 2007, drafted since 2011, projected since 2014, developed since 2019:

With thrill and pride, here's the announcement: a 4-year cicle of development has been completed, and Floflis DNA-Grass have been launched!

**PS**: Because of some stuff to refine, update and setup for launch continuation, this blogpost should be short; although a longtime retrospective is still deserved and due. This blog post should receive a follow-up later.

To be direct: Floflis 1.0 and Floflis Server 2023 had their development finished in this 2023's ending, and are now launched.

Shortly, what these mean:

- Floflis Server 2023 is a continuation of Ubuntu Server, but Floflis' way of being 🏐💝
- Floflis 1.0 is the building blocks for the next Floflis releases: currently aiming at PCBs (such as Raspberry Pi), Termux and old computers such as those that used to run "WindOS"🪟 3X; but later aiming at modern computers and mobile devices

Floflis has finally received something that has been slowly developed since 2019: Floflis Update. With this, you'll receive the latest fixes or improvement patches.

The releases' files will be published on Floflis site and GitHub as soon as possible later today.
