Yesterday I've left the whole day working on Floflis' blog. And today, at morning, in less than two hours I've personalized the whole blog.

It loads a local logo (were reading from Floflis site), haves its title (did it today), personalized menu items (needs translation), added Esperanto language (needs a pull request to Bootstrap theme), and added its first two posts with tags and categories.

I don't see GoHugo as a good platform for building sites, not even for blogs, but for now it is being totally useful for building blogs.

And probably Floflis Central will support on building blogs, using this platform.
